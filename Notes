States:
    Local state: Belongs to single component
    Cross component state: State is affected by multiple components (Props)
    App wide state: Managing state app wide

Redux vs React context:
    Context is quite complex as compared to redux context (depends)
    Context is great if data is not changing a lot

How redux works:
    One store for all states
    Components will not directly change data in store hence we have reducer functions
    Reducer functions changes data and stores
    Components triggers/dispatches actions
    Action is a js object which describes the action/operation reducer should perform
    components dispatches => actions => reducers => store

Installing redux in react app: npm install redux react-redux
